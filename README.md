# Java Collections Learning

This branch contains code and resources related to learning and exploring Java's Collections Framework. The Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces to store and manipulate groups of data as a single unit (collection).

## Topics Covered

- **List**: ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector
- **Set**: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet
- **Map**: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap
- **Queue**: PriorityQueue, Deque, and ArrayDeque

## Key Concepts

1. **List Interface**: Ordered collection, allows duplicates.
2. **Set Interface**: Unordered collection, no duplicates.
3. **Map Interface**: Key-value pairs, no duplicate keys.
4. **Queue Interface**: Orders elements in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) manner.

## Code Examples

- This code Implements a simple keyAnalyzer to understand collections in detail.
## Learning Goals

- Understand the various data structures provided by the Java Collections Framework.
- Learn when to use each collection type based on performance and use case.
- Implement examples that demonstrate real-world applications of these collections.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `learning/collections` branch.
3. Compile and run the Java files using your IDE or the command line.
