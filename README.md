# Java Multithreading Learning

This branch focuses on learning Java's multithreading and concurrency features. Multithreading in Java allows concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximize CPU usage.

## Topics Covered

- **Thread Creation**: Using `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.
- **Thread Lifecycle**: New, Runnable, Running, Waiting, Terminated.
- **Concurrency Utilities**: Executors, Thread Pools, `Callable` interface, and Future tasks.
- **Synchronization**: Managing shared resources, locks, and `synchronized` keyword.
- **Advanced Concurrency**: Using `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CountDownLatch`, and `Semaphore`.

## Key Concepts

1. **Thread Creation**: Learn how to create threads by extending the `Thread` class and implementing the `Runnable` interface.
2. **Thread Synchronization**: Understand how to prevent race conditions by using synchronized blocks and methods.
3. **Thread Pools**: Manage multiple threads efficiently using Executors and thread pools.
4. **Concurrency Utilities**: Explore the tools provided in `java.util.concurrent` for managing complex multithreaded applications.

## Code Examples

-  Basic example of creating and starting a thread.
- Demonstrates how to synchronize threads to avoid race conditions.
-  Shows how to use thread pools for efficient multithreading.
-  Implements the classic producer-consumer problem using wait/notify.

## Learning Goals

- Understand how Java handles multithreading and concurrency.
- Learn how to manage shared resources between threads.
- Implement advanced concurrency mechanisms to handle complex multithreaded tasks.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `learning/multithreading` branch.
3. Compile and run the Java files using your IDE or the command line.
