# Java-Learning-Joorney


Welcome to my Java Learning Journey! This repository contains the code, exercises, and projects I've worked on while learning various Java concepts, frameworks, and tools. The goal of this repository is to document my progress and showcase my knowledge to potential recruiters.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several branches, each representing a specific area of my Java learning. Below is a brief overview of the branches and topics covered.

### Branches and Topics

- **`learning/collections`**: Learning Java's Collections Framework, covering `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and more.
- **`learning/multithreading`**: Concepts of multithreading and concurrency in Java, including thread management and synchronization.
- **`learning/jdbc`**: Learning how to connect and interact with databases using JDBC.


## How to Explore

Each branch contains:
- Code examples.
- Explanations of the concepts covered in that branch.
- A `README.md` file specific to that topic, with detailed instructions on how to run the code and what to expect.

To explore a specific topic, simply switch to the relevant branch:
